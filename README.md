Originating in the 1970s with games like Dungeons & Dragons, RPGs have evolved from table-top formats to include online and app-supported versions. Dungeons & Dragons, in particular, has been pivotal in shaping the genre with its complex storylines and character development mechanics, influencing countless other games.
