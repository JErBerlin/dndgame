## About This Game

### Some Background History

Role-playing games, like Dungeons & Dragons, began in the 1970s. These games involve players taking on the roles of characters in a fictional setting, guided by a game master. These games have expanded from playing at a table with paper and pens to include versions that use digital technology and apps.

### Game Overview

This app is a digital role-playing game, although it simplifies some aspects of traditional role-playing games.

#### The Gameplay

- **Game Structure**: The game has a clear start and end. Each game includes several players, which can enter or leave the game at some point.
- **Characters**: Players are given characters with a certain amount of XP (experience points) at the beginning.
- **Game Master (GM)**: The GM starts the game, adds characters, and has certain powers to change the game after it has started. However, the GM is not all-powerful and cannot do everything.
- **Player Actions**: Players can use their XP to perform actions or choose to leave the game, which removes their character from play.

#### Non-Playing Characters (NPCs)

- NPCs can be part of the game from the start or can be added later by the GM. The GM controls these characters, using their XP for actions or choosing to remove them from the game anytime.

### Game Rules

- **Starting the Game**: The GM sets up the game, assigns characters to players, and establishes the initial game conditions.
- **During the Game**: Players take turns using their XP to take actions. The GM can also change the game by adjusting XP or adding characters.
- **Ending the Game**: The game ends when it reaches its planned endpoint.
